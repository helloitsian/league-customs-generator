  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>
    This team sorter prioritizes role selection over rank, then does it's best to balance the teams by rank.
    It supports primary/secondary roles, fill, and auto-fill.
    To specify a player for fill, set their primary role as Fill and select any role for secondary (secondary role won't be used).
    Currently, secondary fill is not supported.
